Data Flow
The following functions are used in the data flow of this project:

Controller: The controller layer is responsible for handling incoming requests, parsing inputs, validating data, and returning appropriate responses. It uses Spring MVC annotations to map URLs to methods and relies on the services layer to perform business logic.
Services: The services layer contains the business logic of the application. It receives requests from the controller, performs necessary computations or data manipulations, and interacts with the repository layer to access data.
Repository: The repository layer is responsible for interacting with the database. It uses Spring Data JPA to perform CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations on entities.
Database Design: The database design follows a relational model with normalized tables. It includes entities such as users, products, orders, and payments.
Data Structure Used
The project uses various data structures such as arrays, lists, and maps to manipulate data within the application. For example, a list of products is maintained in memory to display on the front-end, while a map of user sessions is used to track active users.
